# To-Do-App_Simushi_Mulowa
A command-line To-Do List application written in C++ that allows users to create, view, mark, unmark, and delete tasks, with automatic file saving to ensure data persists between program sessions. This project demonstrates the use of vectors, structures, functions, and file handling to simulate long-term memory in a console-based application.
